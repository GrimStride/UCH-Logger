Simple command line/terminal program for viewing Ultimate Chicken Horse logs in real time

### ONLY TESTED ON WINDOWS!
Technically it should work in Windows, MacOS and Linux, but i have not tested it in the last two, so feel free to report any issue you encounter while using it.

## How to use
- Download the repository and unzip the downloaded file in any folder.
- As long you have Python 3.x installed on your computer, you should be able to run it just by double clicking `uchlogger.py`
